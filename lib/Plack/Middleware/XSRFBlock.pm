package Plack::Middleware::XSRFBlock;

use strict;
use warnings;
use parent 'Plack::Middleware';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This middleware blocks XSRF. You can use this middleware without any
modifications to your application.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The simplest way to use the plugin is:

    use Plack::Builder;

    my $app = sub { ... };

    builder {
        enable 'XSRFBlock';
        $app;
    }

You may also over-ride any, or all of these values:

    builder {
        enable 'XSRFBlock',
            parameter_name          => 'xsrf_token',
            cookie_name             => 'PSGI-XSRF-Token',
            cookie_options          => {},
            cookie_expiry_seconds   => (3 * 60 * 60),
            token_per_request       => 0,
            meta_tag                => undef,
            inject_form_input       => 1,
            header_name             => undef,
            secret                  => undef,
            http_method_regex       => qr{^post$}i,
            contents_to_filter_regex => qr{^(text/html|application/xhtml(?:\+xml)?)\b}i,
            blocked                 => sub {
                                        return [ $status, $headers, $body ]
                                    },
        ;
        $app;
    }

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item parameter_name (default: 'xsrf_token')

The name assigned to the hidden form input containing the token.

=item cookie_name (default: 'PSGI-XSRF-Token')

The name of the cookie used to store the token value.

=item cookie_expiry_seconds (default: 3*60*60)

The expiration time in seconds of the XSRF token

=item cookie_is_session_cookie (default: 0)

If set to a true value, the XSRF token cookie will be set as a session cookie
and C<cookie_expiry_seconds> will be ignored.

=item cookie_options (default: {})

Extra cookie options to be set with the cookie.  This is useful for things like
setting C<HttpOnly> to tell the browser to only send it with HTTP requests,
and C<Secure> on the cookie to force the cookie to only be sent on SSL requests.

    builder {
        enable 'XSRFBlock', cookie_options => { secure => 1, httponly => 1 };
    }

=item token_per_request (default: 0)

If this is true a new token is assigned for each request made (but see below).

This may make your application more secure, but more susceptible to
double-submit issues.

If this is a coderef, the coderef will be evaluated with the following arguments:

=item http_method_regex (default: qr{^post$}i)

Which HTTP methods to check. Can be useful to also handle PUT, DELETE,
PATCH, and the like.

=item contents_to_filter_regex default: qr{^(text/html|application/xhtml(?:\+xml)?)\b}i)

Only modify <form> elements in responses whose content type matches this regex

=over

=item * The middleware object itself,

=item * The request,

=item * The environment

=back

If the result of the evaluation is a true value, a new token will be assigned.
This allows fine-grained control, for example to avoid assigning new tokens when
incidental requests are made (e.g. on-page ajax requests).

=item meta_tag (default: undef)

If this is set, use the value as the name of the meta tag to add to the head
section of output pages.

This is useful when you are using javascript that requires access to the token
value for making AJAX requests.

=item inject_form_input (default: 1)

If this is unset, hidden inputs will not be injected into your forms, and no
HTML parsing will be done on the page responses.

This can be useful if you only do AJAX requests, and can utilize headers
and/or cookies instead, and not need the extra overhead of processing
the HTML document every time.

=item header_name (default: undef)

If this is set, use the value as the name of the response heaer that the token
can be sent in. This is useful for non-browser based submissions; e.g.
Javascript AJAX requests.

=item secret (default: undef)

Signs the cookie with supplied secret (if set).

=item blocked (default: undef)

If this is set it should be a PSGI application that is returned instead of the
default HTTP_FORBIDDEN(403) and text/plain response.

This could be useful if you'd like to perform some action that's more in
keeping with your application - e.g. return a styled error page.

=back

=head1 ERRORS

The module emits various errors based on the cause of the XSRF detected. The
messages will be of the form C<XSRF detected [reason]>

=over 4

=item form field missing

The request was submitted but there was no value submitted in the form field
specified by <C$self->parameter_name> [default: xsrf_token]

=item xsrf token missing

The application has been configured to accept an 'X-' header and no token
value was found in either the header or a suitable form field. [default: undef]

=item cookie missing

There is no cookie with the name specified by C<$self->cookie_name> [default:
PSGI-XSRF-Token]

=item invalid token

The cookie token and form value were both submitted correctly but the values
do not match.

=item invalid signature

The cookies signature is invalid, indicating it was tampered with on the way
to the browser.

=head1 EXPLANATION

This module is similar in nature and intention to
L<Plack::Middleware::CSRFBlock> but implements the xSRF prevention in a
different manner.

The solution implemented in this module is based on a CodingHorror article -
L<Preventing CSRF and XSRF Attacks|http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/preventing-csrf-and-xsrf-attacks.html>.

The driving comment behind this implementation is from
L<the Felten and Zeller paper|https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/teaching/cs261-f11/reading/csrf.pdf>:

    When a user visits a site, the site should generate a (cryptographically
    strong) pseudorandom value and set it as a cookie on the user's machine.
    The site should require every form submission to include this pseudorandom
    value as a form value and also as a cookie value. When a POST request is
    sent to the site, the request should only be considered valid if the form
    value and the cookie value are the same.  When an attacker submits a form
    on behalf of a user, he can only modify the values of the form. An
    attacker cannot read any data sent from the server or modify cookie
    values, per the same-origin policy.  This means that while an attacker can
    send any value he wants with the form, he will be unable to modify or read
    the value stored in the cookie. Since the cookie value and the form value
    must be the same, the attacker will be unable to successfully submit a
    form unless he is able to guess the pseudorandom value.

=head2 What's wrong with Plack::Middleware::CSRFBlock?

L<Plack::Middleware::CSRFBlock> is a great module.
It does a great job of preventing CSRF behaviour with minimal effort.

However when we tried to use it uses the session to store information - which
works well most of the time but can cause issues with session timeouts or
removal (for any number of valid reasons) combined with logging (back) in to
the application in another tab (so as not to interfere with the current
screen/tab state).

Trying to modify the existing module to provide the extra functionality and
behaviour we decided worked better for our use seemed too far reaching to try
to force into the existing module.
